This is really just a skeleton of a library at the moment, but it will let you do some basic things with the GoogleDocs API.  If you're interested in building this out more, send me an email or just fork the project.

SETUP:
Copy google_docs.rb to your Rails project lib directory
Install Crack 
Make a file: config/google_docs.yml with settings for your environments, e.g.:

development:
  email: soandso@gmail.com
  password: pass

(Alternatively, or if you're not using Rails, just edit the google_docs.rb file so that @@config is a hash with this info.)

EXAMPLES:

* Calendars API
	* List calendars on your account
	g = GoogleDocs::Calendars.new
	g.list

* Spreadsheets API
	* Create a spreadsheet
        g = GoogleDocs::Spreadsheets.new
        gs = g.create! :title => "My Cool Spreadsheet" 

	* Add collaborators to a spreadsheet
	g.add_user gs, ["ghostfacekillah@gmail.com", "raekwonthechef@gmail.com"], :writer

        * Get a link to the spreadsheet
	gs.link
